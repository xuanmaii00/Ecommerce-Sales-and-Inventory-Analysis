## Query 1: Sales Summary by Subcategory (Last 12 Months)
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FORMAT_DATETIME('%b %Y', a.ModifiedDate) AS period,
      c.name,
      SUM(a.OrderQty) AS item_quantity,
      SUM(a.LineTotal) AS total_sales,
      COUNT(DISTINCT a.SalesOrderID) AS order_quantity
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` a
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` b ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` c 
ON CAST(b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT) = c.ProductSubcategoryID
WHERE DATE(a.ModifiedDate) BETWEEN (DATE_SUB('2014-06-30', INTERVAL 12 MONTH)) AND '2014-06-30'
GROUP BY 1, 2    
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 2;
